										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>

									

									<p>Hi, my name is Joey Storey and I'm a game developer and programmer. I've been playing games since I can remember, and it's always been my dream to be able to create games of my own. Now that I have the knowledge and skills to create my own games, I'd like to share some of my projects with you. My strong suit when it comes to game development is coding, as I have experience in using multiple coding languages and have written code for several of my own games, but my skills aren't restricted to just that, as I am also capable of planning, project management, 2D image editing, 3D modelling, level design and other fields within game design as well.</p>
									<p>When it comes to coding languages and game engines, I am proficient in C#, Python and HTML as well as Unreal Engine's Blueprints system, and can comfortably use both Unity and Unreal Engine to design games. I can adapt to working both independently as well as in a team, as while I appreciate having total creative control over a project and being able to shape it how I see fit, I enjoy seeing how others can bring their ideas to life within the borders of a game. </p>
									<p>Currently, I am studying A-Level Computer Science and BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Games Development at East Norfolk Sixth Form College. Afterwards, I plan to take a BTEC Level 4 course in Games Development followed by a BSc in Computer Science. I decided on a mixture of Computer Science and Games Development courses in order to widen my skillset and to provide me with more potential career options in the future. I look forward to being able to learn new things as it will allow me to improve the quality of the games that I create, which is something that I strive for.</p>
