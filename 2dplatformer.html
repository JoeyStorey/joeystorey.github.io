									<p>Pickleland Quest is currently my newest game, and is the most refined out of all those in my catalogue. The game is a 2D sidescroller platformer, where the player's goal is to reach the end of each level by traversing through the many platforming challenges that lie within them. In the game's current state, the player has fluid movement controls, being able to move, jump and swing their sword with the camera following them throughout. There are also various enemy types that require the player to take a different approach when encountering them, as well as pickups such as coins and healing potions that can help the player if they take the time to collect them. Although the game is functionally complete, I have plans to expand it in the future by creating even more levels and expanding the player's moveset.</p>
									<p>Have a look at some gameplay footage from the demo level: </p>

									<p>Here's a peek into some of the code behind the scenes. This is the function that manages the player's horizontal movement: </p>

									<p>Pickleland Quest was developed in Unity Engine using C# to code, with asset editing carried out in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
