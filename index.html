											<h1>I'm Joey Storey. Nice to meet you.<br />
											</h1>
											<p>An up-and-coming game developer and programmer with a passion for creating games.</p>
										</header>
										<p>Ever since I was little and I was first introduced to video games, I dreamed of making games of my own. Now, that dream has become reality and I have been able to create my own games along with the systems that make them possible. Have a look at some of my work:</p>

											<h3>Pickleland Quest</h3>
											<p>Pickleland Quest is a 2D sidescroller platformer developed using Unity Engine and C#. In it, the player must traverse perilous levels to reach the end, all the while collecting coins, avoiding hazards and defeating enemies. The game is currently in development and should be finished soon.</p>

											<h3>Turn-Based RPG Battle System</h3>
											<p>In this customizable battle system, the player does battle with an AI-controlled enemy, both of whom have unique attacks and abilities at their disposal. Their stats can be altered to create different fights and scenarios each time. The system was developed using Unity Engine and C#.</p>

											<h3>Text-based Dice roll game</h3>

											<h3>Persona-themed 3D Modelling</h3>
											<p>Despite primarily focusing on programming, my skillset is not restricted to coding. For example, here are some 3D models that I created using Autodesk 3DS Max and ported into Unreal Engine 4. These were later used in a small game project.</p>
